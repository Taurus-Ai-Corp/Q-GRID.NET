# FAST FILING ACTION PLAN
## Parallel India + USA Patent Filing Strategy

**Date:** December 4, 2025
**Inventor:** Effin Fernandez
**Assignee:** Taurus AI Corp, Windsor, Canada
**Status:** URGENT - EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

---

## CRITICAL: GitHub Repository Action Required

### Current Status
Your GitHub repositories (`Taurus-Ai-Corp/quantum-rupee-*`) are **PUBLIC**, which constitutes prior public disclosure.

### Immediate Actions (Before Filing)

**Option A: Make Repositories Private (Recommended for Strongest Patent)**
```bash
# On GitHub.com for each repo:
# Settings → Danger Zone → Change repository visibility → Make private
```
- `Taurus-Ai-Corp/quantum-rupee-zk-kyc` → PRIVATE
- `Taurus-Ai-Corp/quantum-rupee-offline-cbdc` → PRIVATE
- `Taurus-Ai-Corp/quantum-rupee-fraud-detection` → PRIVATE

**Option B: Proceed with Public Repos (Grace Period Strategy)**
- USA: 12-month grace period from public disclosure
- India: NO grace period (absolute novelty required)
- **Risk:** India patents may be challenged based on GitHub publication dates

### Recommendation
**Make repos PRIVATE immediately**, then file patents, then re-publish after filing dates established.

## PART 5: arXiv ENDORSEMENT STRATEGY (No Contacts)

Since you have no existing arXiv contacts, here are alternative approaches:

### Option 1: LinkedIn Outreach
Search for researchers who have published in:
- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)
- cs.CY (Computers and Society)
- cs.LG (Machine Learning)

**Template:**
```
Subject: arXiv Endorsement Request - ZK-KYC/Fraud Detection Research

Dear Professor [Name],

I am Effin Fernandez, founder of Taurus AI Corp. We have developed novel
systems for privacy-preserving KYC and real-time fraud detection that we
believe contribute to the academic literature.

Our work includes:
- Hierarchical Zero-Knowledge KYC with Aadhaar integration
- 99.7% accuracy fraud detection with sub-200ms latency
- Quantum-resistant offline CBDC protocols

I am seeking an endorser for first-time arXiv submissions in cs.CR/cs.LG.
Would you be willing to review our abstracts and consider endorsing?

I can share our technical papers for your review.

Best regards,
Effin Fernandez
```

### Option 2: University Partnerships
- Contact: University of Windsor CS department
- Contact: IIT/IIIT professors in India working on blockchain/fintech

### Option 3: Conference Submission First
- Submit to IEEE/ACM conferences first
- After acceptance, arXiv submission often auto-endorses

### Option 4: ResearchGate/Academia.edu
- Publish preprints there first
- Build academic profile
- Connect with potential endorsers
