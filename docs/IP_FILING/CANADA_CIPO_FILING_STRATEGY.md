## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) filing strategy for TAURUS AI Corp's three core innovations, optimized for the Canadian market opportunity ($150M Indigenous financial inclusion + $8.15B enterprise banking).

### Key Differences: CIPO vs USPTO

| Feature | Canada (CIPO) | United States (USPTO) |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Provisional Applications** | ❌ Does NOT exist | ✅ Available ($70 micro-entity) |
| **Filing Strategy** | Direct regular application | Provisional → Full conversion |
| **Small Entity Threshold** | <100 employees (2025) | ≤500 employees |
| **Small Entity Discount** | 50% reduction | 60% reduction (micro-entity) |
| **Filing Fee (Small Entity)** | CAD $234.90 (~USD $173) | USD $70 (micro-entity) |
| **Examination Timeline** | >2 years typical | 18-24 months typical |

### Cost Comparison: 3 Patents

| Scenario | Total Cost (CAD) | Total Cost (USD) |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **3 Patents (Small Entity)** | $2,114.10 | ~$1,557 |
| **3 Patents (Standard Entity)** | $5,214.78 | ~$3,840 |

---

## 2. SMALL ENTITY QUALIFICATION

### 2025 Expanded Definition

**Small Entity = Entity with <100 employees OR a university**

**Key Change:** Expanded from 50 to 100 employees (effective 2024)

**Source:** [CIPO Small Entity Status](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/canadian-intellectual-property-office/en/what-you-need-know-about-changes-cipos-fees)

### TAURUS AI Corp Status

| Criterion | TAURUS Status | Qualifies? |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Employee Count** | <100 employees | ✅ YES |
| **University Status** | Corporate entity (not university) | N/A |
| **Entity Type** | FZCO (Dubai, UAE) | ✅ YES (foreign entities can qualify) |
| **Filing Date Lock-In** | Status determined at filing | ✅ Permanent for application |

**Result:** TAURUS qualifies for **50% small entity discount**

### Important Lock-In Rule

**Once small entity status is established at filing date, it does NOT change** even if company grows beyond 100 employees during prosecution.

**Example:** If TAURUS files with 20 employees on December 10, 2025, and grows to 500 employees by 2027, still maintains small entity status for that application.

## 3. FILING STRATEGY OPTIONS

### Option A: Direct CIPO Filing (Regular Application)

**Process:**
1. Prepare complete patent application (specification, claims, drawings)
2. File directly with CIPO as regular application
3. Request examination (can be delayed up to 4 years)
4. Respond to office actions during examination
5. Patent granted if approved

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Establishes Canadian priority date immediately
- ✅ No provisional → regular conversion required
- ✅ Straightforward process

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Higher initial cost vs USPTO provisional ($704.70 CAD vs $70 USD)
- ❌ No 12-month "test the market" window
- ❌ Must commit to full application immediately

**Timeline:** 2+ years to patent grant (typical)

---

### Option B: USPTO Provisional → PCT → CIPO National Phase

**Process:**
1. File USPTO provisional patent ($70 micro-entity)
2. Within 12 months, file PCT international application
3. Within 30 months of priority date, enter CIPO national phase
4. Examination and prosecution in Canada

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Lower initial cost ($70 USD provisional)
- ✅ 12-month evaluation window
- ✅ Preserves priority date across multiple countries
- ✅ 30-month window to decide on Canadian filing

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ PCT filing cost ($1,500-$3,000 per patent)
- ❌ National phase entry fees in Canada
- ❌ More complex process
- ❌ Longer timeline to Canadian patent

**Timeline:** 3-4 years to Canadian patent grant (typical)

---

### Option C: Hybrid Strategy (USPTO Provisional + CIPO Regular)

**Process:**
1. File USPTO provisional patent ($70 micro-entity) - Establishes US priority
2. **Simultaneously** file CIPO regular application (CAD $704.70) - Establishes Canadian priority
3. Within 12 months, convert USPTO provisional to regular or PCT
4. Prosecute both applications in parallel

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Dual priority dates (US + Canada) established immediately
- ✅ US "Patent Pending" status with low cost
- ✅ Canadian patent process begins immediately
- ✅ Flexibility to pursue PCT for other countries

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Higher initial cost ($70 USD + $704.70 CAD = ~$589 total per patent)
- ❌ More complex administration (two patent offices)

**Timeline:**
- Canada: 2+ years
- USA: 18-24 months (if provisional converted)

3. **Dual Protection:** Covers both primary markets (Canada + USA) immediately
4. **PCT Flexibility:** Preserves option for international expansion via PCT within 12 months

### Filing Sequence (Week of December 5-12, 2025)

**Monday, December 9:**
- ✅ File 3 USPTO provisional patents ($210 total)
- Status: US priority date established

**Tuesday, December 10:**
- ✅ File 3 CIPO regular applications (CAD $2,114.10 = ~$1,557 USD total)
- Status: Canadian priority date established

**Wednesday, December 11:**
- ✅ Submit 3 IP.com defensive publications ($112.50-$225)
- Status: Global defensive prior art established

**Total Week 1 Investment:** $210 (USPTO) + $1,557 (CIPO) + $225 (IP.com) = **$1,992**

---

### Patent-Specific Filing Priorities

#### High Priority (File Immediately)

**Patent 1: Hierarchical Zero-Knowledge KYC**
- **Canadian Rationale:** Indigenous data sovereignty (OCAP compliance) is **Canada-specific innovation**
- **Market Fit:** Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action #92 (data sovereignty)
- **Competitive Urgency:** HIGH (Polygon ID, Self Protocol expanding to Canada)

**Patent 3: Offline CBDC with Unlimited Transactions**
- **Canadian Rationale:** 229K Northern/remote Canadians without reliable internet
