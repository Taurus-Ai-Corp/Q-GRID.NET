## TEMPLATE 1: FNBC CEO Letter of Support

### Request Email to FNBC

**Subject**: Request for Letter of Support - Q-GRID Grant Applications

---

Dear Mr. Schwean,

Following our discussion about the Q-GRID partnership, I'm writing to request a letter of support for our upcoming grant applications.

We're applying to NRC IRAP (deadline: December 6) and the Indigenous Innovation Initiative (deadline: December 12). A letter from FNBC confirming partnership intent would significantly strengthen both applications.

**What we're asking:**
- A letter on FNBC letterhead (1 page)
- Confirms FNBC's interest in piloting Q-GRID technology
- Describes potential community deployment scope
- Signed by you or appropriate FNBC executive

**What we're NOT asking:**
- Financial commitment
- Binding partnership agreement
- Exclusive arrangement

I've attached a draft letter for your review. Please modify as appropriate - we want this to accurately reflect FNBC's perspective.

The IRAP deadline is December 6. If possible, could we have the letter by December 5?

Thank you for your partnership.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]

**Attachment**: Draft letter (below)

### Draft Letter for FNBC Signature

**[FNBC LETTERHEAD]**

December [X], 2025

National Research Council Canada
Industrial Research Assistance Program
[Address]

**RE: Letter of Support for Q-GRID Technologies Inc. - IRAP Application**

Dear IRAP Selection Committee,

On behalf of First Nations Bank of Canada (FNBC), I am pleased to provide this letter of support for Q-GRID Technologies Inc.'s application to the NRC Industrial Research Assistance Program.

**About FNBC:**
First Nations Bank of Canada is the only Canadian bank with a majority Indigenous client base, serving over 200 First Nations, Inuit, and Metis communities across Canada. With assets exceeding $1.2 billion, we are committed to improving financial access and economic opportunity for Indigenous Canadians.

**Partnership Intent:**
FNBC has engaged in preliminary discussions with Q-GRID regarding their quantum-resistant payment infrastructure. We are particularly interested in their offline payment capability, which addresses a critical need in communities where 40% or more of residents lack reliable internet access.

**Pilot Program:**
Subject to successful completion of due diligence and technical review, FNBC intends to partner with Q-GRID on a pilot deployment to 3 First Nations reserve communities in 2026. This pilot would target approximately 10,000 Indigenous users and demonstrate:

- Offline payment functionality (Bluetooth, NFC, QR)
- 95% cost reduction for KYC verification
- Quantum-resistant security (ahead of SWIFT 2027 requirements)
- Indigenous data sovereignty and community control

**Why This Matters:**
Indigenous communities deserve financial infrastructure that works in their environments. Traditional banking technology fails when internet is unreliable. Q-GRID's approach - building technology WITH Indigenous communities rather than FOR them - aligns with FNBC's values and mission.

**Commitment:**
FNBC commits to:
- Providing community access for pilot deployment
- Contributing banking regulatory expertise
- Supporting grant-funded pilot operations
- Evaluating expanded deployment based on pilot results

We believe Q-GRID's project represents meaningful innovation in Indigenous financial inclusion and Canadian fintech. We recommend their application for IRAP funding support.

Please contact me directly if you require additional information.

Sincerely,

## TEMPLATE 2: NACCA Institutional Support Letter

### Request Email to NACCA

**Subject**: Request for Letter of Support - Indigenous Fintech Innovation

---

Dear NACCA Leadership Team,

Q-GRID Technologies is developing payment infrastructure specifically designed for Indigenous communities - offline-capable, quantum-secure, and community-controlled.

We're applying for the Indigenous Innovation Initiative through Grand Challenges Canada and would value NACCA's institutional endorsement.

**Our approach:**
- Technology built WITH Indigenous communities, not FOR them
- Data sovereignty: Communities control all financial data
- 95% cost reduction for KYC ($5 vs $150-300)
- Offline payments for communities without reliable internet

**Partnership with FNBC:**
We're partnering with First Nations Bank of Canada to pilot this technology in 3 reserve communities. NACCA's endorsement would strengthen our application and signal alignment with Indigenous financial institution priorities.

Would NACCA consider providing a letter of support? I've attached a draft for your review.

I'm happy to present to your board or innovation committee if helpful.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
Q-GRID Technologies Inc.

### Draft Letter for NACCA Signature

**[NACCA LETTERHEAD]**

December [X], 2025

Grand Challenges Canada
Indigenous Innovation Initiative
[Address]

**RE: Institutional Support for Q-GRID Technologies - Indigenous Innovation Initiative**

Dear Selection Committee,

The National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association (NACCA) provides this letter of institutional support for Q-GRID Technologies Inc.'s application to the Indigenous Innovation Initiative.

**About NACCA:**
NACCA is the national network representing Aboriginal Financial Institutions (AFIs) serving Indigenous entrepreneurs and communities across Canada. Our 50+ member AFIs have provided over $3 billion in financing to Indigenous businesses.

**Assessment of Q-GRID:**
We have reviewed Q-GRID's proposed quantum-resistant payment infrastructure and note several features that align with Indigenous community priorities:

1. **Offline Capability**: Critical for reserves without reliable internet
2. **Data Sovereignty**: Indigenous communities control their financial data
3. **Cost Reduction**: 95% reduction in KYC costs benefits underserved communities
4. **Community Design**: Developed with Indigenous input, not imposed externally

**Relevance to Indigenous Financial Institutions:**
Q-GRID's technology could complement the services provided by NACCA member AFIs, particularly in:
- Remote community financial access
- Micropayment enablement for small businesses
- Reduced operating costs for community-based lending

**Endorsement:**
While NACCA is not a direct partner in Q-GRID's pilot program, we endorse the approach and believe it represents meaningful innovation in Indigenous financial inclusion.

We recommend Q-GRID's application for Indigenous Innovation Initiative funding.

Sincerely,

## TEMPLATE 3: Indigenous Community Chief Letter

### Request Email to Community Leadership

**Subject**: Partnership Opportunity - Quantum-Safe Payments for [Community Name]

---

Dear Chief [NAME] and Council,

I hope this message finds the community well. I'm reaching out on behalf of Q-GRID Technologies regarding an opportunity to bring modern payment infrastructure to [Community Name].

**The Challenge We're Addressing:**
We understand that [Community Name], like many reserves, faces challenges with unreliable internet connectivity. Traditional payment systems don't work when the internet is down. Traditional banking KYC costs $150-300 per person, creating barriers to financial access.

**Our Solution:**
Q-GRID has built payment technology that works offline - via Bluetooth, NFC, and QR codes. No internet required. And our KYC costs $5, not $150-300.

**What We're Proposing:**
In partnership with First Nations Bank of Canada, we'd like to pilot this technology in [Community Name] as one of 3 pilot communities. This would mean:

- 500-1,000 community members gain access to offline payments
- $5 KYC vs $150-300 (95% cost savings)
- Community controls all data (data sovereignty)
- Training and employment for community liaisons
- Grant funding covers all costs to community

**What We're Asking:**
We're applying for federal grants to fund this pilot. A letter of support from [Community Name] leadership would strengthen our application.

Could we schedule a conversation to discuss this further? We're committed to doing this WITH your community, not TO your community. If this doesn't fit your priorities, we completely understand.

We're available to visit [Community Name] at your convenience, or meet virtually.

Respectfully,
[YOUR NAME]
Q-GRID Technologies Inc.

- **Community control**: We control our financial data
- **Designed with us**: Not another outside solution imposed on us

**Our Commitment:**
[Community Name] commits to:
- Participating in community co-design sessions
- Supporting pilot rollout to interested community members
- Providing feedback on technology and user experience
- Designating a community liaison for the pilot period

**Endorsement:**
Our Council has reviewed the Q-GRID proposal and supports their application for Indigenous Innovation Initiative funding. We believe this technology could benefit our community and potentially other First Nations communities facing similar challenges.

Respectfully,
