## Email Template 1: Initial Outreach (via General Inquiries)

**To**: FNBC.Service@fnbc.ca
**Subject**: Partnership Inquiry: Quantum-Ready Payment Infrastructure for Indigenous Communities

---

Dear First Nations Bank of Canada Team,

I'm reaching out to request connection with the appropriate executive regarding a strategic partnership opportunity that aligns directly with FNBC's mission of serving Indigenous communities.

**Brief Overview:**

Q-GRID has developed quantum-resistant payment infrastructure specifically designed for communities that traditional banking technology underserves - particularly those with unreliable internet access. We believe FNBC, as the only Canadian bank with 90%+ Indigenous client base, is the ideal partner for a pilot deployment.

I'd appreciate being connected to your President/CEO, Director of Innovation, or whoever handles strategic fintech partnerships.

Happy to provide a full partnership proposal once connected with the right contact.

Thank you,

## Email Template 2: Direct Executive Outreach

**To**: [Executive contact if obtained]
**CC**: FNBC.Service@fnbc.ca
**Subject**: Partnership Opportunity: Quantum-Ready Payment Infrastructure for Indigenous Communities

**Note**: Current FNBC CEO is **Bill Lomax** (appointed May 2023), not Mike Schwean. Keith Martell was the founding CEO who retired in 2023.

Dear Mr. Lomax,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding a strategic partnership opportunity that aligns directly with FNBC's mission of serving Indigenous communities across Canada.

**The Opportunity:**

Q-GRID has developed quantum-resistant payment infrastructure specifically designed for communities that traditional banking technology underserves. With 40% of First Nations reserves lacking reliable internet and traditional KYC costing $150-300 per person, we've built technology that solves both problems:

- **Offline-first payments**: Transactions work via Bluetooth/NFC/QR without internet
- **95% cost reduction**: $5 KYC vs $150-300 traditional cost
- **Quantum-ready security**: NIST FIPS 203/204/205 compliant (ahead of SWIFT 2027 mandate)
- **Community-designed**: Built WITH Indigenous communities, not FOR them

**Why FNBC:**

You're the only Canadian bank with 90%+ Indigenous client base. This isn't a generic fintech pitch - your communities ARE our target users. We've structured this as a partnership, not a vendor relationship:

- 60% Q-GRID / 40% FNBC revenue share
- Grant funding secured to cover pilot costs ($200K-$300K CAD)
- Your regulatory licenses streamline our deployment
- 10,000 users across 3 reserves in 6 months

**The Ask:**

I'd welcome 30 minutes to discuss how Q-GRID can help FNBC extend quantum-safe, offline-capable payment infrastructure to the communities you serve.

Are you available during the week of December 9-13 for a brief call or meeting in Saskatoon?

I've attached a one-page summary of our Indigenous community solution. Happy to provide additional technical or business documentation as helpful.

Thank you for considering this partnership. The Bank of Canada may have shelved their CBDC, but Indigenous communities still need quantum-ready financial infrastructure - and FNBC is uniquely positioned to deliver it.

Warm regards,

## Email Template 3: Follow-Up (If No Response in 5 Days)

**Subject**: RE: Partnership Opportunity: Quantum-Ready Payment Infrastructure for Indigenous Communities

---

Dear Mr. Lomax,

I wanted to follow up on my message from last week regarding Q-GRID's partnership proposal for Indigenous-focused payment infrastructure.

I understand the demands on your time, especially as we approach year-end. If a conversation with you isn't feasible right now, I'd welcome an introduction to the appropriate member of your team - perhaps your Chief Operating Officer Aftab Ahmad or Chief Information Officer Lori Lester.

We're currently applying for NRC IRAP and Indigenous Innovation Initiative grants (total: $200K-$300K CAD) that would fund a pilot deployment at no cost to FNBC. A letter of partnership intent from FNBC would significantly strengthen these applications.

The grant application deadline is December 12, so timing is important. Even a brief conversation this week would be valuable.

Would [DATE] or [DATE] work for a 20-minute call?

Thank you again for your consideration.

Best regards,

Effin Fernandez

## Email Template 4: Alternative Contact (Director of Innovation)

**To**: Director of Innovation / Director of Technology, FNBC
**Subject**: Quantum-Ready Payment Infrastructure Partnership - Q-GRID + FNBC

---

Dear [NAME / Director of Innovation],

I'm reaching out regarding a fintech partnership opportunity that could position FNBC as the first Indigenous-serving bank with quantum-resistant payment infrastructure.

**Background:**

Q-GRID has built offline-capable, quantum-safe payment technology specifically designed for communities without reliable internet access. With the Bank of Canada shelving their CBDC project and SWIFT mandating post-quantum cryptography by 2027, there's a clear gap in Canadian fintech - and Indigenous communities need solutions now.

**Partnership Proposal:**

We're proposing a 6-month pilot deployment across 3 FNBC-served reserve communities:
- 10,000 users targeted
- 60/40 revenue share (Q-GRID/FNBC)
- Grant-funded (no FNBC capital required)
- Your regulatory licenses, our technology

**Why Now:**

We're submitting applications to NRC IRAP and the Indigenous Innovation Initiative this month. A partnership MOU or letter of support from FNBC would strengthen our applications and unlock $200K-$300K in grant funding.

Would you have 30 minutes in the next two weeks to discuss? I'm happy to travel to Saskatoon or meet virtually at your convenience.

Attached is our Indigenous community solution overview.

Best regards,

## Phone Script: Initial Call with FNBC

**FNBC Phone**: 1-888-454-3622

**Objective**: Schedule in-person or video meeting with decision-maker
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes max

---

**Opening:**

"Hi, this is [NAME] from Q-GRID Technologies. I'm calling about a fintech partnership opportunity specifically designed for First Nations communities. Is this a good time for a brief conversation, or should I schedule a callback?"

**If they have time:**

"Thank you. I'll keep this brief.

Q-GRID has built payment technology that works offline - via Bluetooth and NFC - specifically for communities without reliable internet. With 40% of reserves lacking broadband, we think FNBC's clients would benefit significantly.

We're applying for federal grants totaling $200K-$300K that would fund a pilot deployment at no cost to FNBC. A partnership letter from FNBC would strengthen our application considerably.

The grant deadline is December 12. Could we schedule 30 minutes with the appropriate decision-maker - perhaps Mr. Schwean or your Director of Innovation - sometime this week or next?"

**If they ask what's in it for FNBC:**

"Three things:
1. Revenue share - 40% of all pilot revenue comes to FNBC
2. Technology differentiation - you'd be the first Indigenous bank with quantum-ready infrastructure
3. Grant funding covers all costs - no FNBC investment required

We're not asking FNBC to buy anything. We're proposing a partnership where we bring technology and funding, you bring community relationships and regulatory licenses."

**Closing:**

"What's the best way to get on [decision-maker's] calendar? Should I email them directly, or is there an assistant who manages scheduling?"
