## ⚡ Beat the 2027 SWIFT PQC Mandate: Quantum-Ready Banking Today

---

## **THE CRISIS**

**24 months remain.** SWIFT mandates post-quantum cryptography (PQC) by 2027. Your bank is not ready.

### The Quantum Threat
- ⏰ **Timeline**: By 2028, RSA-2048 encryption (used by ALL Canadian banks) becomes vulnerable
- 🌍 **Scope**: Affects every transaction your customers make globally
- 💰 **Cost**: $500M-$1B emergency migration if delayed (per industry estimates)
- 🚨 **Compliance**: SWIFT mandate is mandatory (no option to decline)

### Current Status: 0/75 Canadian Banks Quantum-Ready
- Big banks (RBC, TD, BMO, Scotiabank): ~0% PQC readiness
- Credit unions: ~0% PQC readiness
- Payment processors (Moneris, Interac): ~0% PQC readiness
- **Only Q-GRID**: Production-ready NIST FIPS 203/204/205 deployed

## **WHY NOW?**

### SWIFT Deadline: 24 Months
- Dec 2027: Deadline for PQC migration
- That's less time than typical bank IT projects take
- Every month of delay increases emergency risk

### National Quantum Strategy: $360M Investment
- Canada investing heavily in quantum technology
- Government wants domestic solutions (Q-GRID is Canadian)
- Banks aligned with government priorities = faster approvals

### Bank of Canada CBDC Gap
- Shelved their own digital loonie (Sept 2024)
- Created opportunity for private-sector alternatives
- Q-GRID is the private-sector quantum-ready solution

### Competitive Window
- ONLY Q-GRID offers this today
- In 18-24 months, competitors will copy
- First-mover advantage expires (move now or lose)

---

## **RISK MITIGATION**

### "Quantum computers won't exist by 2027"
**True risk**: Q2 2025 - IBM roadmap extended. BUT:
- SWIFT deadline still 2027 (regardless of quantum timeline)
- Industry consensus: Defensive migration prudent (like Y2K)
- Better safe than sorry ($500M vs $0 regretted cost)

### "Our current encryption is secure"
**SWIFT disagrees**: Mandate is mandatory (not optional)
- All banks upgrading by 2027 (you'll be forced anyway)
- Proactive > reactive (cost difference: 10x)

### "This is too expensive"
**Math**: $250K investment vs $5M emergency cost
- Payback: < 2 months (in avoided costs)
- CFO will approve (strong ROI)
