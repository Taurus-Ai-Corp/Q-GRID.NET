---

### STAGE 3: STRATEGIC (Month 3-4) - $500K-$5M+ Expected

#### Grant 3A: National Quantum Strategy ($500K-$5M CAD)

**Program Overview**:
- Government of Canada quantum computing initiative
- Total budget: $360M over 5 years
- Streams: Research ($100M+), Commercialization ($100M+), Workforce ($60M+)
- Typical project: $500K-$5M over 3 years
- Approval: 8-12 months (planning, review cycles)

**Why Q-GRID Qualifies - **CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY**:
- Only Canadian company with post-quantum cryptography (PQC) already deployed
- SWIFT PQC mandate 2027 = $500M-$1B emergency migration cost
- Q-GRID solution = $250K-$500K per bank (vs $1M+ emergency cost)
- National security: Quantum threat timeline + SWIFT compliance mandatory

**Application Focus**: "Quantum Cybersecurity Migration PaaS for Canadian Financial Institutions"

**Strategic Framing**:

*"By 2028, RSA-2048 encryption (used by all Canadian banks) becomes vulnerable to quantum computers. SWIFT mandates PQC migration by 2027 (24 months away). Q-GRID has already solved this problem with production-ready NIST FIPS 203/204/205 implementation.*

*Without proactive funding now, Canadian banks will face $500M-$1B emergency migration costs in 2026-2027. Q-GRID's Quantum Cybersecurity Migration PaaS eliminates this crisis - delivering $500M-$1B in avoided costs for the banking sector.*

*This grant funds the 4th PaaS service (Quantum Cybersecurity Migration) as foundational infrastructure for Canadian financial resilience."*

**Project Objectives** (3-year plan):
1. Develop comprehensive quantum migration assessment tool (banks self-assess readiness)
2. Build quantum-resistant hybrid signature library (NIST standard)
3. Create migration playbooks for 5+ financial institution types (banks, credit unions, payment processors)
4. Deploy to 20+ Canadian financial institutions as pilot customers
5. Establish Q-GRID as leading quantum-safe fintech provider (PR + thought leadership)

**Budget** ($2M for 3-year project):
- Quantum cryptography R&D: $600K
- Bank integration services: $500K
- Testing/validation infrastructure: $400K
- Workforce training (quantum-skilled engineers): $300K
- Contingency/operations: $200K

**Strategic Partners to Include**:
- Hedera Hashgraph (blockchain infrastructure partner)
- NIST (post-quantum cryptography standards body)
- Bank of Canada (strategic alignment letter)
- Canadian Bankers Association (partnership letter)
- 3-5 pilot banks (LOI - confidential)

**Timeline**:
- Planning/research phase: Dec 2025 - Jan 2026
- Application submission: Feb 15, 2026 (end of Month 3)
- Review cycle: 3-4 months (May-June 2026)
- Approval decision: July 2026
- Funding release: August 2026
- Project start: September 2026

**Contact**:
- National Research Council (NRC): Quantum coordination office
- Website: https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/quantum
- Expected submission cycle: Quarterly intake

**Success Probability**: MEDIUM (50-60%) - Highly competitive, but Q-GRID has unique advantage (only company with deployed PQC)

**Key Differentiator**: Q-GRID is "shovel-ready" - infrastructure already exists, just needs deployment capital. Most competitors still in lab phase.

## Risk Management for Grants

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Application rejected | Delays funding, pilot timeline | High-quality applications, early submission, multiple grants to diversify risk |
| Grant approval slower than expected | Delays pilot launch | Secure bridge financing, run pilot with limited scope until funding released |
| Unexpected compliance requirements | Project delays, cost overruns | Engage compliance consultant early, monthly regulatory check-ins |
| Difficulty recruiting for grant-funded roles | Project delays | Pre-identify candidates, offer above-market rates using grant funds |
| Community expectations exceed grant scope | Relationship strain | Clear communication of grant limitations, agree on Phase 1 vs future phases |

---

## Sustainability Beyond Year 1

**Grants are bridge funding**. Long-term sustainability requires:

1. **Revenue from Operations** (Months 6+):
   - Transaction fees (Phase 1 Indigenous): $50K-$100K/year
   - Enterprise SaaS (Phase 2 credit unions): $500K-$1M/year
   - Quantum migration services (Year 2+): $2M-$5M/year

2. **Strategic Partnerships**:
   - FNBC revenue share (60% Q-GRID, 40% FNBC)
   - Credit union partnerships (3-5 institutions)
   - Bank quantum migration contracts (10+ institutions by Year 2)

3. **Venture Capital** (Optional Year 2+):
   - If grants + revenue insufficient for growth
   - Target: $5M-$10M Series A (conservative valuation: $50M+)
   - Investors: Canadian fintech VCs, strategic corporate investors (banks, payment processors)
